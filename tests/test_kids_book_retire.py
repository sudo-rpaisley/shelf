"""The boot-time `kids_book` retirement (`app.database._retire_kids_book`).

Every test here drives the step through `init_db()` / `get_db()`, never a
bare `sqlite3.connect`. Two reasons, and both have bitten before:

- `reparent_children` reads `copies_live`, a TEMP view only `get_db()`
  creates. ~25 test sites call `_run_migrations` on a bare connection and
  stay green only because they never reach a merge.
- The step takes `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. An open fixture transaction makes it
  wait out the full busy timeout, so seeds are committed before it runs.

Seeds use raw `_insert_item(media_type="kids_book")`, which bypasses the
write funnel — that is the point: the funnel refuses the value this step
exists to remove.
