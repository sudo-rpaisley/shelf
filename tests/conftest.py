    complete, so the numbered entry the fixture exists to exercise becomes a
    no-op and the test passes with that entry deleted.

    For a *table* the fixture simply omits the CREATE. For a *column* the trap
    is quieter and only opened up at migration 39. `_is_benign_migration_error`
    forgives `duplicate column name` for versions <= `_PRE_ATOMIC_MAX_VERSION`
    (21), and every column added to a MIGRATION_TABLES-managed table before
    that — 16-19 on `series_meta` — sat under the amnesty, so a fixture could
    run the current CREATE and the redundant ALTER was waved through. Migration
    39 (`tags.media_type`) is the first one above the line, and there the same
    fixture raises instead.
