"""E2E tests: the component-load guard (static/js/component-load-guard.js).

T2 of the alpine-component-load-failure plan. T1 (commit f736be0) added the
guard itself; this file drives every one of the four contracts it names
against a *real* broken load — never a hand-simulated one:

  - one `console.error` per distinct lost script, however many names it owns;
  - one toast per page, however many scripts or swaps;
  - the message never contains "Alpine Expression Error" (the string the
    E2E page guard below already filters on, see `attach_page_guard`);
  - `typeof window[name]` is reported only for the four page-scoped names
    (browsePage, scanPage, intakePage, coverDrop) — the other 25 are
    anonymous Alpine.data factories and never globals.

Four groups, matching the plan:
  (a) the four page-scoped scripts, each on its own page;
  (b) the former host, components.js — once on a base.html shell (/browse,
      with a toast), once on a fresh, unconfigured /setup (no toast: that
      shell loads neither app.js nor #toast-container, G50);
  (c) the two components components-item.js owns that a page can be missing
      without any static x-data to scan (hcResultCard, manualAddForm),
      reached through a *real* HTMX swap, not injected markup. hcResultCard
      is still swap-only; manualAddForm gained a page-load root on /scan with
      issue #120's manual entry panel, so its case below is reported at
      alpine:initialized and the swap only proves the card's instances are
      covered too;
  (d) one control: the guard is silent on a healthy page, including after a
      real swap, proving the htmx:afterSwap listener itself is inert when
      nothing is actually lost.

Reaching these two components without live third-party credentials
------------------------------------------------------------------
`hcResultCard` only ever arrives via `#hc-results`' `hx-get
/api/hardcover/search`, gated on `has_hardcover` (`app/routers/pages.py:128`)
— true only once a `hardcover_token` setting exists — and even then
`search_hardcover` (`app/routers/hardcover.py:46`) calls the real Hardcover
GraphQL API, which this offline suite cannot reach deterministically. Rather
than fake the DOM swap (forbidden by the task, and indefensible under G31 —
a stub that authors its own markup asserts nothing about the real template),
these tests set a *fake* token (enough to satisfy `has_hardcover` and render
the search box) and intercept the browser-to-server `/api/hardcover/search`
request itself with `page.route`, fulfilling it with `fragments/
hardcover_search_results.html` rendered by the real Jinja template offline
— the same discipline `tests/e2e/test_scan.py`'s `_render_card`/
`_render_status_card` already use for `fragments/scan_result.html`, and the
same *mechanism* (`page.route` fulfilling a real HTMX request) that
`test_scan.py::test_camera_overlay_reads_the_right_fields_through_a_real_scan_with_a_notice`
already uses for `/api/scan`. The request that swaps the card is real; only
the far side (a live Hardcover account) is substituted.

`manualAddForm` needs no such substitution: `media_type=dvd` with the
12-digit code "999999999999" is a deterministic route to a `not_found` card,
and since #123 it is literally offline — `upc_stub` in `conftest.py` serves
that code the recorded `400 INVALID_UPC` the live API answers with, so the
card is reached through the real router with no request leaving the machine.

Toast timing
------------
`app.js`'s `showToast` removes its own element after 3000ms
(`setTimeout(function() { el.remove(); }, 3000)`), so a DOM-presence check
run any time after that races a real timer and is not what "at most one
toast across repeated swaps" needs to prove — a page that fires two toasts a
tick apart and later has zero in the DOM would look identical to a page that
never fired one. Instead, `_TOAST_WATCH` (installed via `page.add_init_script`
— immune to the CSP, exactly like `test_csp.py`'s own violation probe)
installs a MutationObserver on `document` before anything else on the page
has run, counting every append of the guard's own toast text specifically
(app.js fires its own unrelated toasts for real scan/intake outcomes),
independent of when the browser later removes it.

Where this suite's own dirt goes
---------------------------------
Every test here deliberately drives a page through a broken-script shape:
losing a script that a live `x-data="name"` root depends on makes Alpine's
CSP build throw an uncaught (async, via setTimeout) error for every
expression in that root's scope that touches the component's state — dozens
per page. That is exactly the failure `assert_page_clean`
(`tests/e2e/conftest.py`) exists to catch, so no test here may use the
shared `page`/`authed_page` fixtures (their teardown calls
`assert_page_clean` unconditionally). Each test builds its own context and
page inline via `attach_page_guard(ctx.new_page())` (G44 — the lint at
`scripts/check_test_conventions.py` requires that exact same-line form),
asserts on the fallout it just caused, then clears both recorder lists
(`_finish`, below) before calling `assert_page_clean` — proving nothing
*unexpected* rode along, not gaming the guard.

#
#  - A `requestAnimationFrame` poll for `#toast-container` before attaching
#    the MutationObserver: on a light page (/browse) the guard's own
#    notify() call can beat the *first* animation frame, so the observer
#    attaches after the toast already landed and reports 0. Observing
#    `document` itself (guaranteed to exist the instant this script runs,
#    before the parser has even reached <html>) with `subtree: true`
#    removes the race entirely — recording starts before Alpine, or
#    anything else, has run a single line.
#  - A raw append count on #toast-container: app.js's own scan/intake flows
#    fire their own toasts for real outcomes (e.g. a scan result), so a
#    page that both breaks a script *and* drives one of those actions sees
#    more appends than the guard alone produced. Filtering added nodes by
