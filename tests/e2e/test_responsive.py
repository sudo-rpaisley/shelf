"""E2E: responsive-geometry gates for every top-level page.

The unit suite renders HTML and the lints read class strings, so neither can
see a layout that is the wrong shape — only rendered geometry can (G41). Two
failure modes, and a row can only ever hit one of them, so both are gated:

- `test_no_horizontal_overflow` — the row does not fit, so the layout viewport
  widens and the page scrolls sideways. #14 (List View button clipped), #33
  (intake title field 9 characters wide on a phone), #35 (Settings at 519/640px
  against a 390px viewport) and 0.8.0's nav-bar overflow are all this shape,
  and every one of them passed the whole suite before being reported by hand.
- `test_no_collapsed_text_controls` — the row fits *too well*: a `min-w-0`
  column has a hypothetical main size of 0, so it never triggers a wrap and
  shrinks to nothing while its fixed-width siblings keep every pixel (G43).
  The page measures perfectly and the control renders no characters, which is
  why an overflow gate alone is not enough. Found on its first run: the restore
  passphrase at 53px of content, and `item_edit.html`'s three-up row at 43px
  per field.

Both report the *innermost* offender and its geometry, because "the page is
640px wide" is not actionable and "passphrase input right edge 550px" is.
