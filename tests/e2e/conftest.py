# Uncaught-page-error guard (issue #34)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Alpine's CSP build re-throws a failing template expression asynchronously
# (setTimeout), so a broken guard surfaces as an uncaught page error and
# nothing else: no assertion in any test sees it, and the suite stays green
# over a permanently noisy browser. Measured before the fix: 33 such errors
# across 16 tests, every one of them from a single template expression.
#
# Every Page in this suite is guarded. Call attach_page_guard() immediately
# after each ctx.new_page() (before any navigation), and assert_page_clean()
# before the owning context closes. `grep -rn 'new_page(' tests/e2e/` must
# show no unguarded hit. assert_page_clean() settles for the re-throw itself,
# so a call site needs no wait of its own even when the page has just
# navigated.
#
# Alpine also console.warns the failing expression *by name* just before it
# re-throws, so those warnings are collected too and printed with the failure —
# a bare pageerror reports only "Cannot read property of null or undefined"
# and a minified stack, which names nothing.

# No opt-out ships and no clearing mechanism is documented. If a future test
# must expect an uncaught error, design an explicit scoped suppression
# contract before adding that test.
