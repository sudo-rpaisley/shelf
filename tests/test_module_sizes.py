"""Size guards for the modules split in Lever 5.

`app/routers/items.py` reached 2,481 lines and 30 routes — 38% of all router
code. It was flagged for splitting in `CODE_REVIEW_2026-03-28.md` and again in
`MULTI_USER_HOUSEHOLDS.md`, and it *grew* +135 lines between the two reviews.
`app/templates/settings.html` reached 1,517 lines with 15 `x-data` blocks,
5.3× the next-largest template, and was repeatedly described in plan docs as
"the largest template with the thinnest E2E coverage."

Nothing stopped either from growing, so these caps do. They are deliberately
loose — headroom for ordinary work, tight enough that a module drifting back
toward god-object size fails here and prompts a split instead of a review
comment nobody acts on.
