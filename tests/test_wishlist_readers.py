"""Every reader that means "wishlist" reads the list, not `owned = 0` (#125).

The discriminating row is the whole point of this file: an item with
`owned = 0` and **no** wishlist membership. Under the old readers it was
indistinguishable from a wishlisted item; under the new ones every reader
must exclude it. It is seeded with raw SQL on purpose, so it stays bare even
after `tests/conftest.py`'s `_insert_item` grows a `wishlisted=True` keyword
for the member rows in this file to opt into explicitly.

Plan 1 keeps the invariant *on the wishlist ⇔ `owned = 0`*, so this row
cannot arise through any app writer yet. Plan 2 makes it a real, reachable
state; these pins are what prove the readers are already ready for it.
