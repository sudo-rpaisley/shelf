"""Fresh and upgraded databases must end up with the same schema (G1).

Two bootstrap routes exist. A legacy database replays the append-only
`MIGRATIONS` tuple; a fresh one gets `SCHEMA` plus `MIGRATION_TABLES`, whose
`CREATE TABLE` statements run *after* the migrations loop and therefore never
see the ALTERs. So a column added only as a migration is missing on fresh
installs, and a column added only to a CREATE is missing on upgrades. Both
halves ship green — each path is internally consistent, and no test exercised
the other.

This is G1's own Verify script, promoted to a gate.
