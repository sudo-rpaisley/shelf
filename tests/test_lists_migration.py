"""Migrations 33-36 on a database that predates them (issue #125).

The fixture here is deliberately built *without* the current
`MIGRATION_TABLES`, following `test_items.py::
TestMigrationLoggingDefersOutsideTransaction::_legacy_db` rather than the
column-specific test beside it. `MIGRATION_TABLES` now contains the `lists`
and `list_items` CREATEs, so running it first would pre-create both tables and
turn numbered entries 33 and 34 into `IF NOT EXISTS` no-ops — the test would
then pass with entry 33 deleted.

That is not a hypothetical. `_run_migrations` runs the numbered loop *before*
`executescript(MIGRATION_TABLES)`, and `_is_benign_migration_error` answers
"benign" for `no such table` whenever the table is named in
`MIGRATION_TABLES`. So a missing numbered CREATE records its seed version as
applied and leaves a permanently empty table, on real user databases, while a
current-bootstrap fixture stays green.
