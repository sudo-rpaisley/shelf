# Shelf

A self-hosted home library catalog — scan barcodes or photograph whole shelves, and Shelf fetches metadata and cover art, tracks lending, series and reading, and works offline in a bookstore. Single Docker container, SQLite, no cloud.

</p>

## Quick Start

```bash
mkdir -p shelf-data
docker run -d \
  --name shelf \
  -p 18888:18888 \
  -v ./shelf-data:/data:z \
  dangahagan/shelf:latest
```

Open **https://localhost:18888** and create your admin account via the setup wizard. That's it.

> **Note:** Shelf uses HTTPS with a self-signed certificate generated on first run. Your browser will show a certificate warning — this is expected. Click through to proceed.

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  shelf:
    image: dangahagan/shelf:latest
    container_name: shelf
    ports:
      - "18888:18888"
    environment:
      - CERT_SAN=${CERT_SAN:-DNS:shelf,DNS:localhost}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data:z
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Add your machine's hostname or IP so other devices on your network
# can access Shelf without certificate warnings
CERT_SAN=IP:192.168.1.100,DNS:shelf,DNS:localhost
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CERT_SAN` | `DNS:shelf,DNS:localhost` | TLS certificate Subject Alternative Names. Add your machine's IP or hostname so other devices can connect |
| `SECRET_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | JWT signing key. If unset, generated at `data/signing.key` (0600) on first start; an existing key from before 0.30 is moved there from the database on the first start after upgrading, so sessions survive. Set it explicitly to run several instances against one database |
| `SHELF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | Encryption key for stored API credentials. Auto-generated at `/data/encryption.key` if not set. Set it explicitly (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) so the data directory alone can't decrypt credentials |
| `SHELF_TRUST_PROXY` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` when running behind a reverse proxy so client IPs are read from proxy headers |

## Persistent Data

All data is stored in a single volume mounted at `/data`:

```
data/
  shelf.db        — SQLite database (your entire catalog)
  covers/         — cached cover images
  certs/          — auto-generated TLS certificates
  encryption.key  — key for API credentials stored in the DB
                    (unless SHELF_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set)
  signing.key     — signs login sessions (unless SECRET_KEY is set)
```

Keep both key files out of anything you share. The database itself holds no
key material.

**Backups:** Copy the `data/` directory, or use the built-in backup/restore feature in Settings — with an optional passphrase, backup downloads are AES-encrypted and safe to store off-site.

## Features

### Scanning and Cataloging
- **Camera barcode scanning** on mobile — tap to scan ISBNs and UPCs, on iPhone and iPad as well as Android (EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E)
- **USB/Bluetooth scanner support** — works with any scanner that sends Enter after the barcode
- **Photo intake** — bulk-add from a photo of your shelves; a vision model (Anthropic API, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or fully local Ollama) reads the spines and you confirm before import. Rows typed DVD or Video Game are looked up on TMDb or IGDB at confirm, on an exact title match
- **Title search** — search Open Library, TMDb, or IGDB by title when you don't have a barcode
- **Cascading metadata lookup** — Open Library, Hardcover, Google Books, and more
- **Cover art pipeline** — automatically fetches covers from multiple sources with manual upload fallback
- **Store Mode (offline PWA)** — scan in a bookstore with no signal and get an instant Owned / On wishlist / Not in library verdict; unknown books queue on-device and land on your wishlist when back online

### 8 Scan Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Add** | Scan barcodes to add items with full metadata lookup |
| **Wishlist** | Scan at a bookstore to save items you want |
| **Lend** | Select a borrower, then scan items to check them out |
| **Return** | Scan items to check them back in |
| **Move** | Select a target location, then batch-scan items to relocate them |
| **Inventory** | Select a location, scan everything there, then check for missing items |
| **Lookup** | Scan to check if an item is in your collection — no changes made |
| **Quick Rate** | Scan to mark items as read/completed |

### Media Types
- Books, audiobooks, eBooks, DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, comics, kids' books, and video games
- Link physical and digital formats together
- Video game support with IGDB metadata and 30+ platforms (Atari 2600 to PS5)

### Collection Management
- Filter and search by media type, location, reading status, ownership, lending status, and custom tags
- Reading tracking — want-to-read, reading, and read with start/finish dates
- Series tracking — grouped by series with position numbers, gap detection, and one-click "add missing volumes to wishlist" via Hardcover; series synopses, plus rename/merge/disband from the series card
- Stats dashboard — books read per year, collection growth, top authors, and value-over-time charts
- Locations — organize by room, shelf, or any system you like
- Checkout system — lend to borrowers and track who has what, with overdue badges and an optional daily reminder digest (ntfy/webhook)
- Wishlist — mark items as unowned alongside your catalog
- Public share links — read-only wishlist or collection pages for gift ideas, revocable anytime
- Goodreads & StoryGraph import — upload your export as-is; format auto-detected, covers fetched automatically
- Custom tags — free-form tags (`signed`, `first-edition`, …) with a tag filter on Browse
- Bulk editing — select items in Browse to move them, change type or reading status, or set and clear series in one go
- Valuation report — location-grouped, print-ready collection value report for insurance (via ISBNdb)
- Display currency — 20 currencies for every value surface (formatting, not conversion)
- CSV import/export, plus a portable archive — export the whole collection as one zip **including cover art** and merge it into any Shelf instance without refetching a cover

### Multi-User
- **Admin** — full control: settings, users, locations, sync, bulk ops, logs
- **Editor** — add/edit/delete items, scan, manage covers, checkout/checkin
- **Viewer** — browse, search, reading status, export, view stats
