"""Trash: restore, delete permanently, empty expired.

Every route names its own role — there is no router-level dependency, so the
editor/admin split is visible at each decorator: **Restore is editor** (who can
delete), **Delete permanently and Empty expired are admin**.

**Each mutation opens its block with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`**, above the read that
decides what to act on. sqlite3's deferred isolation takes no lock for a bare
`SELECT`, so a row restored between a purge's guard read and its delete would
otherwise be destroyed while live (G18). Nothing logs inside a locked block:
a log handler opens its own connection and would wait on this one (G3).

Every action answers with the re-rendered Trash list, swapped over
`#trash-list`; the routes pass state and the fragment holds every sentence
(G58).
