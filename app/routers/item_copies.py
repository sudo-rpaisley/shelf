"""Physical copies, edited in place on the item page.

`item_copies` was built from the storage end: Shelf Fill scans a copy barcode,
Arrange orders copies on a shelf, and the columns for condition, acquisition
and provenance have existed since 0.36.0 — but until now the only way a second
copy came into being was merging two items, which is a side effect rather than
a way to say "I own two of these". These five routes are that missing end.

Every route is `editor`; the item detail page itself is `viewer`, so the
template gates each control on the same roles and a viewer's page is unchanged.
The three mutations return the re-rendered `fragments/item_copies.html`, the
pattern `routers/tags.py` uses for the tag chips, and the two GETs are the
panel and the collapsed block Cancel restores.

**Every write goes through `app.services.item_copies`** — `add_copy`,
`update_copy` and `trash_copy`. The source-scanning guards in
`tests/test_item_write.py` refuse a raw statement against this table from any
module but the service, matched by repository-relative path, so a module named
like the service earns no exemption (G88). Describe the funnel by function
name here rather than quoting the statements it owns, because those same
guards read this file (G53).

**Each mutation opens its block with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.** sqlite3's deferred
isolation opens no transaction for a bare `SELECT`, so the existence check, the
numbering read and the promotion decision would otherwise all be taken outside
the write lock and acted on blind (G18). The service functions document that
they expect the lock to be held.
