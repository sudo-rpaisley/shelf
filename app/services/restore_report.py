"""What an add path says, and does not overwrite, when the funnel restored.

`item_write.insert_item` resolves a collision with Trash by restoring the
trashed row and returning its id with a flag (`item_write.was_restored`). The
three helpers here are what the callers of that funnel need in order to
*report* the restore and to avoid undoing it, and they live in a service
rather than in `routers/items_common.py` because several routers need them
and the router module is at its size cap.

**The reporting side is a vocabulary problem, not a formatting one.**
`restored` is a new scan status, and a scan status reaches five consumers,
three of which render an unlisted status as an **error** (G62):

- `static/js/app.js` — `SCAN_OK_STATUSES`, which drives the toast class and,
  through `scanCardOutcome`, the scan overlay's ternary in `scan.html`.
- `app/templates/fragments/recent_scans.html` — a **persisted** class chain
  reading `scan_log.result`, so a miss here is red forever rather than for
  one request.
- `app/templates/fragments/scan_result.html` — five separate enumerations.
- `app/routers/shelf_fill.py` — post-processing in **Python**, where an
  unlisted status falls through the whole block (G103).
- `tests/e2e/test_scan.py` — three hand-written vocabulary tables (G78).

**The not-overwriting side is `keeps_stored_cover`.** A restore leaves every
stored field alone, but the cover download runs in the *caller*, after the
funnel has returned — so the cover is the one stored field a restore can lose,
and it is lost outside the funnel where the funnel's rule cannot reach.
