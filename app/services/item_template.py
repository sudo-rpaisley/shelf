"""What "start from this item" means — the copyable-field subset.

One declaration with two consumers: the copy-template endpoint behind the
manual form's in-form picker (`app/routers/items.py`, issue #19), and the
`?from={id}` prefill on the Scan page's manual entry panel
(`app/routers/pages.py`, issue #120). Declared here rather than in either
router so the two cannot drift, and in `services/` rather than in
`routers/items_common.py` because that module is at its size cap and the
cap's own instruction is to move domain logic out here (G67).

Not to be confused with `app/services/item_copies.py`, which is about
*physical* copies of an item — rows a user owns more than one of. This module
is about copying an item's *fields* onto a new one.
