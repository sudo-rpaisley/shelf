"""Portable library archive — export/import between Shelf instances.

Format contract (frozen — see .devdocs/archive/completed/plan-issue-16-portable-export-import-impl.md):

    manifest.json          {"format": "shelf-archive", "version": 1,
                            "exported_at": <ISO-8601 UTC>, "app_version": null,
                            "counts": {...}}
    library.json            flat data — locations/tags by NAME, items keyed
                            by an archive-local id (not preserved on import).
                            Each item carries a boolean `wishlisted` beside
                            `owned` (#125): membership of the wishlist list,
                            which is not a column on `items`. An archive
                            written before that key existed has it *absent*,
                            which means "derive it from owned"; a present
                            value belongs to the boolean contract and the
                            write funnel judges it. Absent and present-invalid
                            are deliberately different answers (G87).
    covers/<item id>.jpg    copy of each exported item's cover, keyed by that
                            same archive-local id

Deliberately excluded: users, settings, share_links, scan_log, log_entries —
credentials and instance-specific/operational data. A full-instance move is
the DB backup's job (see app/routers/settings.py).

Reading an archive goes through ArchiveReader (read_archive), which treats
the zip as hostile: it is admin-uploaded, but "admin uploaded it" is not a
guarantee the admin made it. T3 adds the merge importer on top.

    """Return the item's `copies` array, checked against every constraint the
    table carries, or raise `ValueError` naming the first violation.

    **`None` and `[]` are different answers.** `None` means the key was absent
    (or JSON null) — every archive taken before 0.38.0 — and the caller keeps
    the legacy one-copy-from-`location` behaviour. `[]` means the archive said,
    explicitly, that this item has no physical copies, which is a real state
    for a located wishlist item (G86) and must survive its own round trip.
    Collapsing the two is what B3 was.

    **Validation happens before a single row is written, and that is the
    point.** `apply_plan` catches a per-item exception into `errors` and then
    returns normally, so `get_db()` commits everything written before the
    raise. A violation discovered on the second of two copies would otherwise
    leave the item, its tags, its first copy and any location the item alone
    created committed, while the report tells the user that item failed. An
    archive is untrusted input; it must not be able to raise `IntegrityError`
    out of an import, and it must not be able to half-import an item either.

    The constraints, all from `SCHEMA` in app/database.py:
      - `UNIQUE(item_id, copy_number)` — integer, unique within the item
      - `CHECK(acquisition_price IS NULL OR acquisition_price >= 0)`
      - `CHECK(is_primary IN (0, 1))`
      - `copy_barcode UNIQUE` collection-wide — *not* checked here: a
        collision with a row this import did not write is salvageable by
        dropping the barcode, which the caller does, and reporting it.

    Type-checking the text columns is part of that same guarantee, not
    housekeeping. `location` reaches `.strip()` in the location resolver and
    `copy_barcode` reaches it here, both *after* the item and its primary copy
    are already written — so a `{"location": {}}` used to raise
    `AttributeError` out of the middle of an import and leave an item, a copy
    and a location committed while the report said nothing was imported. That
    is exactly what this branch's own G85 forbids. B4.

    Returns the entries sorted by `copy_number`. `is_primary` is normalised to
    the first copy only when the array does not already carry exactly one — an
    array with no primary, or with several, is repaired rather than refused,
    since the partial unique index `idx_item_copies_one_primary` would
    otherwise raise and a malformed flag is not worth losing an item over. A
    *valid* non-first primary is preserved as given: rewriting it moved the
    physical primary away from the location `items.location_id` still named,
    which is the reader disagreement #116 exists to remove. B2.

    locations/tags/borrowers/series are get-or-create by NOCASE name and
    never overwritten. reading_log/checkouts install only for newly created
    items. valuation_history installs only into an empty table.

    Covers changed in 0.7.0: an archive cover is installed only onto an item
    with no local cover unless `replace_covers=True`. Replacements are folded
    into `covers_installed` here so the v1 report shape — and the scripts
    reading it — are unaffected; the plan/apply endpoints report them
    separately.
