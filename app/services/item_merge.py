"""Re-point a merged row's child records before the row is deleted (#86).

``items`` has five child tables declared ``ON DELETE CASCADE``. Deleting the
merged row therefore destroys its loan history, tags, cross-format links and
physical copies unless each one is re-pointed at the kept row first. Only
``scan_log`` and ``reading_log`` ever were, so a merge looked like it worked
and silently took the rest with it.

``item_copies`` became a casualty after the issue was written: first-class
physical copies shipped in 0.36.0, and that table carries acquisition price,
provenance, condition and copy barcode — the least reconstructible data in
Shelf.

Re-pointing is not a plain UPDATE for most of them. Each child table has its
own conflict rule, and getting one wrong raises ``IntegrityError`` mid-merge:

- ``item_tags`` is keyed on (item_id, tag_id), so a tag both rows carry
  collides.
- ``item_links`` is unique on (item_a_id, item_b_id), needs both columns
  re-pointed, and collapses into a self-link when the two rows were linked to
  each other.
- ``item_copies`` is unique on (item_id, copy_number) and has a partial unique
  index allowing one primary copy per item, so copies must be renumbered and
  at most one primary may survive.
- ``checkouts`` has no uniqueness constraint and is the only plain UPDATE.
- ``list_items`` is keyed on (list_id, item_id), so a list both rows are on
  collides — and it carries one rule the others do not, because ownership
  and wanting are mutually exclusive. ``app.services.lists.reparent`` holds
  both; the move lives there because that module is the one write path for
  the table.
