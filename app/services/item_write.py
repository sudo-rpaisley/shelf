"""The one place that inserts a row into `items`, and the one place that
updates user-supplied fields on one.

`INSERT INTO items` used to exist at 13 sites — `_save_item`, manual add, the
scan path, CSV import, photo-intake confirm, Hardcover sync and discover, ABS
sync, the store's bare-wishlist fallback, the game/DVD/book adds, and archive
import. G25 recorded the consequence: adding a metadata column meant auditing
all 13 and deciding capture-or-gap at each, and a plan that assumed
"everything funnels through `_save_item`" silently stored NULL for the new
`language` column on the headline photo-intake path.

`insert_item()` is that funnel. Adding a column to `items` now means adding it
to `SCHEMA` and `MIGRATIONS` (still both — see G1) and passing it wherever it
is actually known; no site can silently drop it, because an unknown field name
raises instead of being ignored.

**The value stage** (issue #54). Field *names* were the first invariant;
values are the second. `validate_item_fields()` enforces, once, every value
rule an item row carries — the ISBN check digit and the canonical 13/10 pair,
`media_type` membership, location existence, game-platform membership, the
reading-status domain, the `owned` flag — and raises a typed `ItemValueError`
subclass when one fails. `insert_item()` runs it before building the
statement, and so do the two update funnels:

- `update_item_fields(db, item_id, fields)` — one row, always stamps
  `updated_at`; with empty `fields` it is a bare touch.
- `update_items_fields(db, item_ids, fields)` — the bulk form, one statement.

Every route that writes a user-supplied value goes through one of the three
and reduces to `except ItemValueError as e`, rendering the message on its own
surface. Only system-managed columns (`cover_path`, `estimated_value`,
Hardcover ids, the `location_id = NULL` cascades, name-keyed series writes)
still use a raw `UPDATE items SET`; `tests/test_item_write.py` allowlists
those and fails on any other.

`items.location_id` is also the compatibility seam for first-class physical
copies (#97). When a normal item write supplies that field, the write funnel
mirrors it into the item's primary copy after the item statement succeeds.
A null location never invents a copy, and secondary copies are never moved by
the legacy field. This keeps every existing add/edit/import surface working
while copy-specific UI can be introduced separately.

A field that is not present is not validated: an update that touches only
`notes` never reads `isbn`. Callers that hold a *provider's* value (an
Audiobookshelf ASIN, a Hardcover edition ISBN) pre-clean it with
`isbn.canonical_isbn_pair()` and pass `None` on failure — the funnel is strict
in both cases; dropping versus refusing is the caller's decision.

**Call these inside an existing `with get_db() as db:` block**, never around
one. The caller owns the transaction: several sites need the insert and their
follow-up writes (tags, scan log, cover path) to commit together, and
`cursor.lastrowid` is only meaningful on the connection that did the insert
(G16, G18).
