"""UPC Item DB client — barcode → retail product, plus retail-title normalisation.

This is the one place the UPC Item DB endpoint lives. It used to have two
independent copies: one buried in the TMDb client (a UPC product lookup has no
business living there) and one raw, unpaced `client.get` in the scan router,
which ignored the `api.upcitemdb.com: 1.0` interval `app/config.py` declares.

Retail titles are not search queries. Four live lookups produced:

    Alice Madness Returns (PC DVD)
    Tom & Jerry: Lost Dragon / Giant Adventure [DVD]
    Super Mario: Odyssey - Nintendo Switch
    Goodfellas [DVD]  Feature Thriller Drama  Action  Suspense  Drama …

Stripping the bracketed tag is not enough — the last row keeps nine appended
retail category keywords that no bracket-or-suffix rule removes. So `clean_title`
strips, and `search_queries` is willing to *shorten*: a ladder of progressively
shorter leading fragments, tried in order until a provider answers. Both the
film path (TMDb) and the game path (IGDB) climb this same ladder.

`clean_title` and `search_queries` are pure — no I/O, so they test offline.
