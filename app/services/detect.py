"""Media-type detection for a freshly scanned item.

Pure functions only — no I/O, no `httpx`, no DB, no imports from
`app.routers`. `app.config` is fine to import; it is pure data.

Four tiers, tried in order, each one only allowed to act on evidence it
actually has:

1. Barcode prefix — an ISBN (978/979 EAN-13, or ISBN-10) is a book-family
   item. A UPC/EAN that is *not* an ISBN carries no format information by
   itself (a UPC is issued to the retail product, not to "books" or
   "discs"), so it falls through to the next tier instead of deciding here.
2. Title markers, in four arms: platform names (PS5, Nintendo Switch,
   PC CD, ...) say video_game; retail format tags ([DVD], Blu-ray, ...) say
   dvd; software-medium tags (CD-ROM) say video_game; audio tags (Audio CD,
   Compact Disc, CD) say cd. All four run only when `_is_hardware_title` is
   false: this tier **declines to decide a hardware title at all**, because a
   format, medium or audio word on a hardware listing is a shelf-listing
   artifact rather than evidence about the object (`G68`). The order — platform, format, medium, audio —
   is load-bearing at every seam and measured at each. Platform before
   format so a game whose title happens to carry a format word in its own
   subtitle (a DVD-ROM PC game) still resolves as a game. Format before
   medium *and* audio because every film title in the probe corpus carrying
   "CD" is a disc bundle that also carries a format tag ("Purple Rain
   [DVD/CD Combo]"), so format-first files all three as discs where either
   later arm would file a concert Blu-ray as a game or a CD. Medium before
   audio because the bare "CD" audio marker matches *inside* "CD-ROM".
3. Category — confirmatory only, and only for video_game and cd. See the two
   prohibitions above `_PLATFORM_MARKERS` below; nothing here may decide dvd,
   and no category *naming a platform* may decide video_game. Both admitted
   categories name the medium itself.
4. No signal, in three parts. **First**, recognised hardware: a title
   carrying a hardware word *and* a platform marker or a hardware brand
   (`_is_hardware_title`) is a console, controller or headset. Because tier 2 declines such a title
   outright, this arm is the only thing that decides one — unless tier 3's
   medium-naming category fires, which still outranks it. That is a weaker answer than a
   detection and a stronger one than nothing — it says what the item is
   *not*, which is enough for a caller to decline a film search it would
   otherwise lose (`signal="hardware"`). It sits above the hint branch
   deliberately: a dropdown choice asserts what the item *is*, not that a
   film search on a title containing "Console" will match. Then a deliberate
   non-book hint (`cd`, `dvd`, `video_game`) stands (`signal="hinted"`);
   otherwise resolve to a concrete `MEDIA_TYPES` member anyway and say in
   the reason that it is a fallback, never a detection (`signal="none"`).
   The `media_type` is **always** a `MEDIA_TYPES` member — never `"auto"`,
   never an unchecked hint string.

The return is a `Detection`, not a bare tuple: the tier that decided is worth
more to a caller than the verdict alone. `_scan_upc` reads `signal` to skip
the TMDb ladder for hardware, because that ladder's shortest rung answers
"PlayStation" with a confident match for a different film (`G46` — missing
enrichment is recoverable, wrong enrichment is not).

G46 (see GOTCHAS.md): this module reads the *raw* scanned title, never a
shortened search-query rung. `app/services/upcitemdb.py`'s `search_queries`
ladder strips exactly the platform/format markers tier 2 matches on — by the
time a title reaches its shortest rung, "[DVD]" and "(PC DVD)" are already
gone. Callers must pass the title as scanned, not a ladder rung.

# Madness Returns (PC DVD)" is a game whose own title carries the string
# "DVD"; checking format first would file it as a disc. "Purple Rain [DVD/CD
# Combo]" is a disc bundle whose own title carries the string "CD"; checking
# audio before format would file it as an album. Each arm is checked after
# the one that can be wrong about it.
#
# Two prohibitions, both learned from the probe sample, both apply to the
# *category* tier (3) below, not to this title-marker tier:
#   - No category value ever decides dvd. 2 of 2 discs in the sample were
#     categorised as Electronics > Video > Televisions.
#   - No category that names a *platform* (e.g. "Electronics > Video Game
#     Consoles") ever decides video_game. A platform category describes the
#     shelf the product sits on, not what the product is — it held a Switch
#     cartridge and a PlayStation 5 console in the same sample.
#
# The second prohibition creates a title-tier problem too: "PlayStation" is
# a plausible platform marker for a game's title, but "PlayStation 5
# Console" is not a game — it is the console itself. Resolution: a small set
# of hardware words (_HARDWARE_TERMS) suppresses the platform check for that
# title. "PlayStation 5 Console" hits "console" and is excluded from the
# platform match entirely, so it falls through this tier with no verdict and
# lands on the tier-4 fallback (dvd, honestly labelled) rather than on
# video_game — Shelf has no hardware media type, so "not a game" is as far
# as detection can honestly go. "The Legend of Zelda ... - Nintendo Switch"
# has no hardware word, so its platform marker fires normally. The same
# predicate also reads `_HARDWARE_BRANDS` below, so a headset that names its
# maker rather than its platform is recognised the same way.

    A hardware word alone is not enough — `Console Wars`, `Air Traffic

    lets this predicate gate *all* of tier 2 without catching those three: a
    bare hardware-word test would suppress `Console Wars [DVD]`'s own format
    tag and file a film with no detection at all. Narrow enough to act on at
    tier 4, and narrow enough to decline every tier-2 arm on.

    The second half is a platform name *or* a listed brand, because a
    peripheral usually names its maker and not its platform: `Sony PULSE 3D
    Wireless Headset`, `Logitech G Pro X Gaming Headset`. A brand alone is
    not enough either — `Astro Boy`, `Turtle Beach` and `The Corsair` are
