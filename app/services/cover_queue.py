"""In-memory queue for cover enrichment, drained by one lifespan worker.

Cover lookups used to happen inline: a scan, a CSV import or an intake
confirm downloaded covers while the caller waited, with no pacing between
requests. This module moves that work off the request path — producers
enqueue item ids, one worker drains them serially, and the per-host limiter
in `outbound` is what makes the drain polite.

Deliberately in-memory, with no schema of its own: durability is
approximated by `requeue_recent_missing()` at startup, and durable per-item
cover state belongs to the cover-review-queue plan rather than here.

**Transient failures are detected by exception, not by a `None` return.**
`covers._download` swallows transport errors by design (it must stay safe
for its synchronous callers), so a cover-host blip that `outbound.fetch`'s
own retries did not absorb arrives here as "no cover found" rather than as
an error. That is a cover-less item, not a failed job: it is counted by the
Settings "items without a cover" figure, and its recovery paths are the
startup requeue and the manual Retry Missing Covers button. Do not widen
`_download`'s exception handling to change this.
