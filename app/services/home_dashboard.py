"""Read-only catalogue summary for Shelf's future Home page.

The dashboard deliberately knows nothing about which media types are physical
or digital. It reports facts already present in upstream Shelf — catalogue
size, ownership, lending, cover completeness, media-type counts and recent
additions — so future media families can appear automatically without this
service needing edits.
