"""Physical copies: the one write path for ``item_copies``, plus the
compatibility helpers for upstream issue #97.

Shelf's catalogue row remains the shared descriptive record. ``item_copies``
represents individual physical objects and deliberately does not infer whether
a media type is physical or digital.

During the transition, ``items.location_id`` remains the compatibility field
used by the existing UI. The primary copy mirrors that value when one exists;
secondary copies are never moved by legacy item writes.

**The write funnel.** ``insert_copy`` and ``update_copy`` are the only way a
row reaches or changes in this table, and ``purge_copy`` (Trash's Delete
permanently) and ``delete_copies_for_item`` (the archive import's placeholder
removal) the only ways one leaves it, exactly as
``item_write.insert_item`` is for ``items``. ``add_copy`` is the funnel's
front door for the item page: it owns numbering and the primary decision, so
no caller has to reproduce either.

**Trash is how a copy is removed.** ``trash_copy`` and ``restore_copy`` are
the only writers of ``deleted_at`` here — the twin of
``item_write.trash_item`` / ``restore_item`` for ``items`` — and both funnels
refuse the column as a caller-supplied field name, so it cannot be reached
through ``insert_copy`` or ``update_copy`` either. The item page's Remove copy
calls ``trash_copy``; the Trash page restores and purges.
Column names are validated against ``PRAGMA table_info(item_copies)``, so an
unknown column raises instead of being silently dropped, and unset columns are
left out of the statement so the ``SCHEMA`` defaults apply. Two set-based
statements stay raw and are allowlisted by path in ``tests/test_item_write.py``:
migration 26's backfill in ``app/database.py`` (which runs before any
application code is importable) and ``backfill_legacy_locations`` below. Both
are ``INSERT ... SELECT`` over the whole table, which a per-row funnel cannot
express.

**The read seam.** Every read of copies in this module goes through the
``copies_live`` view, which hides a copy whose own ``deleted_at`` is set and
every copy of an item whose ``deleted_at`` is set (``app/database.py``,
``get_db``). Three reads deliberately stay on the physical table, because
each one exists to predict a UNIQUE violation and the constraint sees trashed
rows: ``backfill_legacy_locations`` (its ``NOT EXISTS`` guard against the
literal copy number 1), ``sync_primary_location`` (numbering the new primary)
and ``add_copy``'s numbering read. ``restore_copy`` reads the physical table
for a different reason — it must find the row the view is hiding — and is
allowlisted with that reason stated, because a reader who assumes the
UNIQUE-prediction rule would draw the wrong conclusion from it.

**The position-clearing rule is the funnel's, for every copy.** A location
change clears the copy's location-scoped ``position_order``, because a shelf
position means nothing on a different shelf. ``sync_primary_location`` has
carried that rule for the primary copy since issue #97; the funnel now applies
it to every copy, which is what Shelf Fill's ``_place_exact_copy`` got wrong.
A caller that passes ``position_order`` explicitly — Shelf Fill's append,
Arrange's renumber — wins, and no clearing is attempted. A move to the same
location keeps the position.
