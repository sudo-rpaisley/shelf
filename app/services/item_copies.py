"""Physical-copy compatibility helpers for upstream issue #97.

Shelf's catalogue row remains the shared descriptive record. ``item_copies``
represents individual physical objects and deliberately does not infer whether
a media type is physical or digital.

During the transition, ``items.location_id`` remains the compatibility field
used by the existing UI. The primary copy mirrors that value when one exists;
secondary copies are never moved by legacy item writes.

    placed physical object. The operation is idempotent.
