# Development

Everything here runs from inside the repository root. `CLAUDE.md` and
`GOTCHAS.md` in the repo hold the deeper, agent-oriented notes; this page is
the human quick start.

## Stack

Python 3.12 · FastAPI · SQLite via raw `sqlite3` (no ORM) · Jinja2 · HTMX ·
Alpine.js (**CSP build**) · Tailwind CSS (built locally, committed) · pytest
+ Playwright. One container, no other services.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgahagan/shelf.git && cd shelf
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make setup            # dev deps, npm (tailwind), Playwright Chromium
```

## Run it

```bash
# Docker, same as production (uses docker-compose.yml — dev defaults:
# port 18889, ./data-dev, host networking):
make dev              # docker compose up -d --build
make dev-logs
make dev-down

# Or bare uvicorn with a local data dir (plain HTTP on :8000):
DATA_DIR=./data-dev uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

`SHELF_DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=1` is handy while iterating on login or `/api/`.

## Tests and lints

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `make test` | Unit + integration, quiet and parallel (~1500 tests, excludes `tests/e2e/`) |
| `make test-fast` | Re-run only the last failures |
| `make test-verbose` | Per-test output |
| `make test-e2e` | Playwright E2E; starts its own server |
| `make test-contract` | Live UPC Item DB contract check — spends one trial lookup; run at release, never on a gate |
| `python -m pytest tests/test_items.py::test_x -v` | One unit test |
| `python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_scan.py -v -m e2e` | One E2E file |
| `make checks-fast` | Offline lints: secrets, CSRF, `items_live`/`copies_live` read seams, Alpine CSP, service-worker version, test conventions, README test-count badges |
| `make badges` | Restamp README's two test-count badges from `pytest --co` — CI runs this on the push to `main` (the `restamp` job below); run it locally to see your work, but **never commit the result in a pull request** |
| `make checks` | All checks incl. `pip-audit` and licenses (network) |
| `make css` | Rebuild `static/css/app.css` and restamp `SW_VERSION` — run it after any template/JS change to see your work, **but leave the output out of a pull request** |

Unit and E2E tests **cannot share one pytest invocation** — always use the
targets above. `make verify` enforces a minimum test count, so deleting
tests fails CI.

**CI runs five jobs**, and three of them behave differently on a pull request
than on a push to `main`:

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| `restamp` | Push to `main` only. Rebuilds with `make css` and `make badges`, then commits **only the generated paths that actually changed** — any of `README.md`, `static/css/app.css`, `static/sw.js`, and never one already current — as `github-actions[bot]` (`Restamp generated output after merge`) and pushes to `main`. `test`, `css` and `e2e` below check out whatever this job produced (or the pushed commit unchanged, on a pull request or when nothing needed restamping) rather than the raw push |
| `test` | `make test` and `make checks-fast` |
| `e2e` | `make css`, then `make test-e2e` — the suite is always judged against a stylesheet rebuilt from the templates in that checkout |
| `css` | Rebuilds with `make css`. The **rebuild** runs on every event, so a template or `tailwind.config.js` change that breaks compilation still fails cheaply. The **comparison** against the committed output fails on push to `main` and is advisory (a `::notice::`) on a pull request |
| `generated-output` | Pull requests only. Fails if the merge result changes `static/css/app.css`, `sw.js`'s `SW_VERSION` or either README badge count, relative to the base branch |

The split exists because **a pull request carries no generated output** — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Those three artefacts are regenerated on
`main` by CI — the `restamp` job above, triggered automatically by the push
that merges the pull request, with no human step in between — so on a pull
request the staleness checks cannot be satisfied and report instead of
failing; the `generated-output` job is what keeps the files out of the diff in
the first place. A parse failure is never downgraded: a check whose parser has
stopped matching is a disarmed tripwire, not staleness, and it fails
everywhere.

`generated-output` compares the merge result against the base it merges into,
not against the commit the branch was cut from — so a branch that is merely
behind `main` is not blamed for a restamp `main` made since, while a merge that
resolved a generated value to the branch's stale side is still caught.

Run `make test`, `make test-e2e` and `make checks-fast` locally before pushing.

CI does **not** run `make test-contract`, and neither does any gate target.
The release gate makes no live third-party call — that is a stated invariant
(`architecture.md`, Testing), and the contract test is the deliberate exception
that lives outside it.

### Service worker versioning

`static/sw.js` precaches the store-mode shell **cache-first**, keyed by a cache
name built from `SW_VERSION`. If a precached file's bytes change and the version
does not, returning browsers keep serving the stale copy — neither
`Cache-Control` nor a hard refresh dislodges it, and unit tests, Playwright and
`curl` all bypass Cache Storage entirely.

So `SW_VERSION` is **generated, not written**: it is `v` plus the first 8 hex
chars of a sha256 over the sorted `PRECACHE` paths and their contents.
`make css` stamps it (`scripts/stamp_sw_version.py`); `make check-sw-version`
and `tests/test_store.py` fail if the committed value is stale or hand-edited.
`static/css/app.css` is precached, so a Tailwind rebuild renames the cache by
itself. On `main` the two are committed together by CI's `restamp` job; **in a
pull request neither travels at all** — the stamp is one token, so a restamp
in each PR collides across a batch. On a `pull_request` build
`check-sw-version` and its pin in `tests/test_store.py` report the drift and
pass, and the `generated-output` job refuses a PR that changed the value. A
parse failure still fails everywhere: that is a disarmed tripwire, not
staleness.

One rule survives automation: **never add `sw.js` to its own `PRECACHE`** —
stamping would change the bytes the stamp is derived from and never converge.
`test_stamp_is_idempotent` guards it.

### README test-count badges

README's **unit tests** and **e2e tests** badges quote how many tests each
suite carries. Both are **generated, not written**: `scripts/stamp_test_badges.py`
takes the numbers from `pytest --co` — collection only, so it is offline and
runs in under two seconds — and rewrites the shields.io URLs in place.
`make badges` stamps them, `make check-badges` (inside `make checks-fast`, so
CI runs it) fails if the committed numbers no longer match what collects —
except on a **pull-request build**, where it reports the drift and passes.
Every PR that adds a test would otherwise go red on the badge alone, and a PR
that restamps it collides with every other restamping PR on one README line.
CI's `restamp` job restamps the badge on the push to `main` instead, and the
`generated-output` job refuses a PR that restamped it anyway — which is what
the advisory alone did not prevent.

The counts come from collection rather than from a run on purpose. Collection
cannot pass or fail, so the badge asserts only *"this suite contains N tests"*,
which is a fact about the tree; whether they pass is what the **CI** badge
beside them already says. A badge that re-stated the pass/fail state would be a
second copy of it, free to disagree.

Add a test and forget to restamp and `make checks-fast` fails locally with the
two numbers side by side — the same bargain as `SW_VERSION`. A push to `main`
normally does not go red over it: the `restamp` job restamps the badge before
`test` runs, so `main`'s own gate sees a tree that already matches. The
exception is a run the tip has outrun — if a second merge lands while the first
run is still going, the first run makes no commit and its `test` job judges the
un-restamped tree, badge failure and all. That run goes red and the newer one,
whose tree carries both merges, restamps and goes green. On a pull request it is
the opposite bargain: restamping is what fails, and the drift is reported
instead.

### Responsive geometry

`tests/e2e/test_responsive.py` measures every top-level page at
320/390/430/640/768/1024px and fails on two things a class-string lint cannot
see: a page that scrolls sideways, and a text control squeezed below 80px of
content box. 640, 768 and 1024 are the `sm:`, `md:` and `lg:` breakpoints — a
breakpoint's own width is the worst case for the layout it turns on, since the
wide row has just started rendering and has the least room it will ever have. **Add the
breakpoint width here whenever you introduce a new stacking seam.** A control
that is narrow by design opts out with `data-narrow-ok`, so exemptions stay
greppable.

Tests are isolated: an autouse fixture gives every test its own temp data
dir; use the `client` / `admin_client` / `editor_client` / `viewer_client`
fixtures (CSRF pre-seeded, rate limiting off) and `db` for direct SQL. See
`tests/conftest.py`.

E2E tests fail on a **dirty browser**: every Playwright page is watched for
uncaught errors, and a test that leaves one behind fails at teardown even when
its own assertions passed. The failure quotes Alpine's expression text, which
usually names the culprit outright — and, when there is something to say, the
failed requests, non-2xx `.js` responses and component-registration state that
explain *why* the page broke. On a healthy page that block is absent and the
message is unchanged.

There is still no general opt-out, but there is now **one sanctioned
suppression contract**, and `tests/e2e/test_component_load_guard.py` is both
its definition and its only user. It applies to a test whose *subject is the
error* — one that deliberately breaks a script load to prove the app reports
it. The sequence is fixed: build the page inline with
`attach_page_guard(ctx.new_page())`, assert the expected error signature
yourself, clear the recorder lists on the Page, then call `assert_page_clean`
before the context closes. Clearing is not evasion — the errors are what the
test just asserted, and the trailing check still proves nothing *unexpected*
rode along. Any other test that wants to provoke an error needs its own
contract designed first; do not copy this one to silence an inconvenient
failure.

**Never wait with `wait_for_load_state("networkidle")` after a click.** It does
not wait for what you mean: Playwright resolves it immediately when the page has
already reached the state, and right after a click it usually has, because the
request the click starts may not have been issued yet. So the wait returns at
once and the assertion races whatever the click began. Arm the waiter **before**
the click, and pick it by **what the following assertion reads** — not by what
the click fires:

| the assertion reads | the waiter |
|---|---|
| nothing in flight (the click makes no request) | delete the wait; `expect(...)` auto-retries |
| the new document | `with page.expect_navigation(): click()` |
| the response, or the DB behind it | `with page.expect_response(<predicate>): click()` |
| a swapped HTMX fragment | `with page.expect_response(lambda r: "/api/search" in r.url): click()` |

`make check-tests` enforces this with an allowance of zero. `wait_for_load_state`
after a `goto()` is the documented use and stays legal — only the adjacency to a
click or a press is not. **G83** in `GOTCHAS.md` carries the reasoning, including
why `wait_for_url` is not the fix for a handler that redirects back to the URL
it posted from.

## Rules that bite

- **Strict CSP.** No inline `<script>`, no `eval`, no CDNs. All JS/CSS lives
  vendored in `static/`.
- **Alpine CSP build.** Expressions must be simple; nested or bracketed
  `x-model` bindings silently drop input. Guard a *chain* with a ternary, never
  `&&` — the CSP build evaluates both operands before applying the operator, so
  `x && x.prop.length` throws when `x` is `false` or `null` (`x ? x.prop.length
  : ''` is safe, and optional chaining doesn't parse at all). `make
  check-alpine` enforces both, though it only sees the statically obvious guard
  shapes — a plain identifier dereferenced two levels deep or called as a
  method.
- **The script load order in `<head>` is load-bearing**, and `make
  check-alpine` enforces it too. A script under `static/js/` that calls
  `Alpine.data()` is a **classic** script — never `defer`, never `async`;
  `component-load-guard.js` comes **first**, ahead of every registering script;
  and Alpine's own tag is the only deferred one and comes **last**. Disturb any
  of the three and the affected page throws `Undefined variable` once per
  binding, with the guard installed too late to say which file was lost.
- **Raw `fetch()` must send `X-CSRF-Token`.** `make check-csrf` enforces;
  HTMX is configured globally in `base.html`.
- **`MIGRATIONS` in `app/database.py` is append-only.** Never edit or
  reorder an existing entry; migrations must be replay-safe.
- **Browse filters are declared once**, in `app/browse_filters.py`. Add a
  `BrowseFilter(...)` there rather than editing `hx-include` lists, SQL
  conditions or `browse.js` by hand — they all derive from it.
- **Items are created through one function**, `insert_item()` in
  `app/services/item_write.py`. Call it inside an existing `with get_db()`
  block. Adding a column to `items` no longer means auditing a dozen insert
  sites.
- **Items and copies are each read through a view** — `items_live` and
  `copies_live`, both created per connection by `get_db()`. `items_live`
  filters `deleted_at IS NULL`; `copies_live` joins the items relation, so a
  copy is live only if it and its item are untrashed. Write `FROM items_live` /
  `JOIN copies_live`, never the bare tables; `make check-deleted` enforces both
  and matches `JOIN` as well as `FROM`, because several files reach a table
  through a join alone. Writes stay on the physical tables, as do the reads
  that exist to predict a UNIQUE violation and the few that must *find* a row
  the view hides — each allowlist entry states which (`GOTCHAS.md` G107).
- **A route that decides on a `SELECT` guards and writes in one
  transaction.** `db.execute("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")` goes first in the block,
  above the guard query — a bare `SELECT` opens no transaction, so guarding in
  one block and inserting in another takes the write lock only at the INSERT
  and a rival can commit in the window (`GOTCHAS.md` G18). Nothing that opens
  a second connection or writes a log record may run inside that block; carry
  the outcome out (`existing`, `item_id`, `value_error`) and act on it after
  the block closes (G3). A pre-check placed *before* an outbound lookup is
  allowed to read unlocked, because it only saves a paced request — it must
  decide nothing.
- **Item routes live in four modules** — `items.py` (scan, CRUD, search,
  bulk ops), `items_covers.py`, `items_csv.py` and `items_catalog.py` —
  sharing helpers from `items_common.py`. Import that as a *module* and call
  through it; a from-import binds a copy that tests cannot patch. Settings is
  likewise one template per tab under `templates/fragments/settings/`.
- **`from app.config import X` freezes the value at import time.** Read
  `app.config.X` at call time instead; tests override config.
- **Tailwind output is committed — but regenerated by CI's `restamp` job on
  `main`, not in a pull request.** The committed `static/css/app.css` is the
  only stylesheet the image ever serves, so a tag placed on a commit whose
  stylesheet is stale ships a page with missing styles and an unstamped
  `SW_VERSION`. `restamp` is what keeps `main` current, but it commits *after*
  the push it reacts to — so the thing to check before tagging a release is
  that `main`'s tip is still the commit you meant to tag. A pull request
  nonetheless leaves the output out: see the `generated-output` job above.
- Before touching migrations, Alpine components, covers, the service worker
  or outbound rate limiting, read the matching entry in `GOTCHAS.md`.

## Submitting changes

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Short form: open an issue first
for anything non-trivial, run `make test`, `make test-e2e` and `make checks`,
and fill in the PR template. Run `make css` to see a template change rendered,
but keep the generated output — `app.css`, `SW_VERSION`, the README badges —
out of the pull request.

## Releases

Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z`; pushing the tag triggers the Docker Hub publish
workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`). `CHANGELOG.md` is the
release artifact — there is no version string in code.
