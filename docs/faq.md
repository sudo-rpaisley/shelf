# FAQ

**Does Shelf need an internet connection?**
For metadata and covers, yes — lookups go to Open Library and friends. The
catalog itself, Browse, Stats, lending and Store Mode's scan verdicts all work
offline. Nothing phones home.

**Is my data sent anywhere?**
Only the ISBN/UPC being looked up goes to metadata providers — plus the title,
where that is all Shelf has: a title search, or a Photo Intake row typed DVD or
Video Game, whose title goes to TMDb or IGDB when you confirm it. Photo Intake
also sends the photo to whichever vision provider you configured — choose
Ollama for fully local. Share links are served by *your* server.

**Do I need any API keys?**
No. Books, covers, DVD titles (via UPC Item DB) and everything else core work
keyless. Keys unlock extras: Hardcover (sync, series checks), IGDB (games),
TMDb (discs), ISBNdb (valuation), a vision provider (Photo Intake). The
keyless tiers are metered per day, though — a heavy cataloguing session can
exhaust one, after which scans come back empty until it resets. A key raises
or removes that limit. Google Books is the one source that accepts a key
without needing one: it works keyless, and a key of your own only buys you a
quota that nobody else is sharing.

The scan card tells you which of these happened rather than making you guess:
no key configured, a key the provider rejected, a provider that is
rate-limiting you right now, a format Shelf has no metadata source for (CDs,
today), or a genuine miss. See
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#a-scan-comes-back-empty-and-the-log-says-a-provider-asked-for-a-long-wait).

**Why HTTPS with a self-signed certificate?**
Phone cameras and offline mode both require a secure origin, so Shelf must
be HTTPS; without a domain, self-signed is the only way to do that out of
the box. (The one exception is Photo Intake's **Take photo** button on a
phone, which opens the native camera app rather than using `getUserMedia`
and works over plain `http://` — but trust the cert for everything else.)
You can trust the cert on your devices or front it with a real one —
see [HTTPS & reverse proxy](https-and-reverse-proxy.md).

**Can I use a USB barcode scanner?**
Yes — any scanner that acts as a keyboard and sends Enter. No setup.

**Does camera scanning work on iPhone?**
Yes, since 0.10.0 (iOS Safari uses a ZXing decoder). It needs HTTPS and a
camera permission.

**What barcodes are supported?**
EAN-13 (ISBN-13 and UPC-like), EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E. ISBN-10s can be typed.

**What about books with no barcode?**
Title search (Open Library), manual add, or Photo Intake of the cover
face-up — the model recognizes the cover, and reads the printed ISBN if the
back cover is showing.

**Can several people use it?**
Yes: admin / editor / viewer roles on one shared library. Per-user reading
tracking and per-household libraries are planned.

**Can I import from Goodreads / StoryGraph / LibraryThing / Libib?**
Goodreads and StoryGraph today (upload the export as-is). LibraryThing and
Libib are on the [roadmap](roadmap.md). Anything else: CSV with at least a
`title` column.

**How do I move Shelf to another machine?**
Copy the `data/` directory — or export a portable archive and import it on
the new instance. See [Upgrading & backups](upgrading-and-backups.md).

**How do I back up?**
Copy `data/`, or Settings → Data → Backup & Restore (optionally
passphrase-encrypted). Portable archive for a credential-free copy with
covers.

**Where are the covers stored?**
`data/covers/`. They're downloaded once and served locally.

**Why did a book get the wrong cover / edition?**
Metadata sources key on ISBN but sometimes collapse editions. On the item
page use **Find cover** to pick another — it works even when the item
already has a cover, not just a blank one — or **Edit** to fix the record.

**I removed a cover by mistake — can I get it back?**
Only indirectly, and only for a book added in the last 48 hours: a
container restart re-queues cover-less recent books for automatic lookup,
which would refetch one. Older items, or a cover you don't want refetched,
need **Find cover** or **Upload** to set a new one by hand.

**Is the valuation a resale value?**
No — ISBNdb list price, i.e. replacement cost. Right for insurance, not for
selling.

**Can I change the currency?**
Yes, Settings → Library → Collection. Formatting only; no conversion.

**Is there an API?**
Not a documented, token-authenticated one yet — the routes exist for the UI
(FastAPI) but require the session cookie. A stable `/api/v1` with personal
access tokens is on the roadmap.

**Kobo / Kindle / OPDS / reading ebooks in the browser?**
Out of scope. Shelf catalogs physical media (and links to your
Audiobookshelf for digital); ebook servers do the rest better.

**What's the license?**
AGPL-3.0. Free to use, self-host and modify; if you run a modified version as
a network service you must publish your changes under the same license.
