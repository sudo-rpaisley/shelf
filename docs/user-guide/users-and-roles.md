# Users & roles

Shelf is multi-user from the first install: one shared library, several
logins, three roles.

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Everything — settings, users, integrations, locations, borrowers, sync, bulk ops, backup/restore, logs, plus all editor rights |
| **Editor** | Add / edit / delete items, all scan modes, covers, lend and return, tags, import / export CSV and archives |
| **Viewer** | Browse, search, Series, Stats, Store Mode, set reading status on items, export CSV |

Cover controls — **Find cover**, **Upload**, **Remove cover**, **Retry
cover** — are editor+; a viewer doesn't see them on the item page at all.
The same goes for **Lend** / **Check in** and **Push to Hardcover** on the item
page, the Series page's rename, merge and disband actions, and Discover's
add-to-wishlist buttons: viewers get the read-only view of each, with the
loan context and the Series list still shown.

The first account created in the setup wizard is an admin. There must always
be at least one admin.

## Managing users

Settings → **Users** (admin): add a user with username, display name, role
and initial password; change a role; reset a password; delete a user.
Deleting a user doesn't touch the catalog — items are shared, not owned.

Every user changes their **own** display name and password from the account
menu in the nav.

## Sessions

Login sets an HTTP-only, secure cookie with a 7-day JWT that refreshes while
you're active, so a device you use regularly stays logged in. **Log out**
from the account menu; to force every device out, change your password.
Login attempts are rate-limited per IP.

## The log viewer

**Logs** in the nav (admin) tails Shelf's application log in the browser:
auth events (logins, failures, role changes), sync runs, metadata and cover
lookups, errors. Handy for "why didn't that cover load" without touching
`docker compose logs`.

## What's per-user today

Only your login, display name and password. Reading status, tags, wishlist
and everything else are shared across the household. Per-user reading
tracking and per-household libraries are on the roadmap (see
[FUTURE_FEATURES in the repo issues](https://github.com/dgahagan/shelf/issues)).
