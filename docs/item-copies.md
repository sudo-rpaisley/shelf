# Physical copies

Shelf distinguishes the shared catalogue description from individual physical
objects through `item_copies`.

A catalogue item may have zero, one, or many copy rows. Copy-specific fields
include condition, acquisition details, provenance, notes, a local/accession
barcode, and physical location. Digital or service-backed availability is not
represented by an `item_copies` row merely because of its media type.

## Compatibility with `items.location_id`

The existing item-level location remains the compatibility field while the UI
is migrated incrementally. When an item write supplies a non-null
`location_id`, Shelf creates or updates one `is_primary = 1` copy. Clearing the
item location clears that primary copy's location but does not delete the
copy. Secondary copies are never moved by the legacy item field.

The upgrade backfill is deliberately conservative: only an item that is both
owned and already has an explicit legacy location receives a primary copy.
`owned` alone is not treated as proof that the item is physical.

The partial unique index on `item_copies(item_id)` permits at most one primary
copy, `(item_id, copy_number)` is unique, and `copy_barcode` is unique across
the collection. Deleting an item cascades to its copies; deleting a location
sets copy locations to `NULL`.

The copy table references the existing `locations` row rather than storing a
place of its own, so the location hierarchy that shipped alongside it in 0.36.0
(upstream issue #98) evolved without changing the catalogue/copy boundary at
all. A copy points at a location node; what that node is *inside* is the
location tree's business — see `app/services/locations.py`.

## The write funnel

`insert_copy` and `update_copy` in `app/services/item_copies.py` are the only
way a row reaches this table, guarded the same way `app/services/item_write.py`
is for `items`: column names are validated against `PRAGMA table_info`, so an
unknown column raises rather than being silently dropped, and unset columns take
their schema defaults. A location change clears the copy's location-scoped
`position_order` — a shelf position means nothing on a different shelf — unless
the caller passes one explicitly, which is how Shelf Fill's append and Arrange's
renumber keep working. Two set-based backfills stay raw and are allowlisted by
path in `tests/test_item_write.py`.

## Which surfaces read copies

Since 0.38.0 (upstream issue #116) these read `item_copies` directly:

- the item page, which lists every copy with its location and shelf position;
- the shelf audit (`/api/inventory/missing`), which expects an item on a shelf
  if *any* of its copies is there, primary or not, and shows a count when two
  copies of one item share a shelf;
- Scan's **Inventory** mode, which confirms on any copy at the audited shelf
  and, when an item has two or more copies and none is here, reports where they
  are instead of moving one;
- Scan's **Lookup** mode, which names every distinct copy location;
- the portable archive, which carries a `copies` array per item.

These still read the `items.location_id` seam: **Browse**, Scan's **Move** mode,
the **valuation report** (`app/routers/valuation.py`) and the Stats dashboard's
**By Location** panel (`app/routers/pages.py`). The first two are deliberate
exemptions with their own planned work. The last two are a decision rather than
an oversight: emitting one row per physical copy would change the totals of an
insurance report, and that question — is a second copy valued separately, or is
value per title? — deserves answering on its own rather than as a side effect.

Where an item has no copy rows at all, every copy-reading surface falls back to
the seam. That is a real state, not only a legacy one: the backfill above is
deliberately conservative, so a wishlist item with a location has no copy row.

**Copies are not reconciled onto a matched item on re-import.** An archive
restores copies for items it creates; an item that already exists locally keeps
its own copies untouched, because merging two copy sets by `copy_number` is a
guess and would duplicate on every repeat import. Revisit if a user asks for
copies to sync on re-import.
