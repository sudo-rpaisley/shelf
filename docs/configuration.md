# Configuration

Shelf is configured in two places: **environment variables** for things the
container needs before it starts (port, certificate, secret keys), and the
**Settings page** (admin only) for everything else. You can run Shelf with no
configuration at all.

## Environment variables

Set these in your `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`, or with `-e` on
`docker run`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CERT_SAN` | `DNS:shelf,DNS:localhost` | Subject Alternative Names for the self-signed certificate. Comma-separated `DNS:<name>` and `IP:<addr>` entries. Add your server's LAN IP and any hostname you'll type in the browser. Only read when the certificate is first generated — delete `data/certs/` to regenerate |
| `SHELF_PORT` | `18888` | Port the app listens on *inside* the container. Usually leave it and change the Compose port mapping instead |
| `SHELF_TRUST_PROXY` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` **only** when a reverse proxy in front of Shelf overwrites `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP`. Without a proxy this lets clients spoof their IP past login rate limiting |
| `SECRET_KEY` | *(auto)* | JWT signing key. Auto-generated and stored in the database if unset. Set it explicitly if you run several instances against one database |
| `SHELF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto)* | Key for API credentials stored in the database. If unset, generated at `data/encryption.key`. Set it (`openssl rand -hex 32`) so the data directory alone can't decrypt credentials |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Where the database, covers and certs live. Only relevant outside Docker |
| `SHELF_DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` | *(unset)* | Turns off per-IP rate limiting. For tests and local development only |
| `SHELF_OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | *(unset)* | Development-only escape hatch allowing an `http://` OIDC issuer/endpoints. Leave unset in production; normal OIDC configuration requires HTTPS |

### Credential overrides

Integration credentials are normally entered in Settings and stored encrypted.
Each can instead be supplied as an environment variable, which **takes
priority** over anything stored:

| Variable | Setting |
|---|---|
| `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` | Hardcover API token |
| `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` | Optional Google Books API key; anonymous lookups remain available when unset |
| `ABS_URL`, `ABS_TOKEN` | Audiobookshelf server URL and API token |
| `ISBNDB_API_KEY` | ISBNdb key (valuation) |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | TMDb credential (DVD / Blu-ray metadata **and** DVD cover search) — either the 32-character v3 API Key or the v4 Read Access Token |
| `IGDB_CLIENT_ID`, `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Twitch developer credentials (video game metadata **and** game cover search — both fields are required) |

Useful with Docker secrets or a secrets manager. Vision-provider keys (Photo
Intake) are Settings-only.

A credential supplied this way behaves like a saved one everywhere it matters,
with two differences worth knowing:

- **The Settings field stays blank.** Shelf never echoes a *secret* back into the
  page, whether it came from the database or the environment. Blank does not mean
  unset — leave it blank and the environment value keeps working. (`ABS_URL` is
  the exception: a server URL is not a secret, so the Audiobookshelf URL field
  shows the value in use.)
- **Shelf cannot remove it.** The "Remove saved key" checkbox only deletes the
  stored row, and the environment variable still takes priority afterwards. To
  change or remove an env-supplied credential, change it in your environment and
  restart the container. The checkbox is hidden when the credential comes *only*
  from the environment; if you also saved one through the form earlier you will
  still see it, and clearing that row changes nothing while the variable is set.

**Test key** works against an env-supplied credential — you do not need to paste
a second copy into the form to check it.

## The Settings page

**Settings** (gear icon, admin only) has four tabs. This is where each option
lives:

### Library

| Card | Options |
|---|---|
| **Collection** | Display currency (20 choices; formatting only, never conversion). Preferred language for title searches |
| **Navigation** | Which tabs appear in the nav. Tabs for unconfigured integrations hide themselves automatically; you can also hide any tab manually |
| **Locations** | Add, rename and delete shelves/rooms. Deleting a location unassigns its items |
| **Borrowers** | People you lend to. Deleting a borrower keeps their loan history |
| **Game Platforms** | The platform list used for video games — 30 built in, add your own |
| **Lending** | "Overdue after N days" for loans without a due date (0 disables). Notification URL (ntfy topic or JSON webhook) for the daily overdue digest, with a **Send test** button |

### Integrations

| Card | Options |
|---|---|
| **Audiobookshelf Sync** | Server URL + API token, **Test**, per-library include/exclude, sync interval, manual sync |
| **Hardcover** | API token, import your Hardcover library, reading-status sync direction and schedule, export to Hardcover |
| **Collection Valuation** | ISBNdb API key, valuate all / test key |
| **Google Books** | Optional API key, **Test Key**. Authenticates the Google Books requests Shelf already makes; keyless access stays enabled without it |
| **Movie Database (TMDb)** | API key for DVD / Blu-ray lookups, and for **Find cover** on a DVD |
| **Photo Intake (Vision)** | Provider: Anthropic (API key + model), OpenAI-compatible (base URL, optional key, model, ingest long-edge), or Ollama (URL, model, ingest long-edge) |
| **IGDB (Video Games)** | Twitch client ID + secret, for game lookups and for **Find cover** on a video game |

Each card has a short inline setup guide for obtaining its credential. Keys
are **write-only** — once saved you see a masked placeholder and a "clear"
checkbox, never the value. See [Integrations](user-guide/integrations.md).

### Data

| Card | Options |
|---|---|
| **Maintenance** | Retry missing covers, backfill synopses, re-run value lookups — each with a live progress stream |
| **Import / Export** | CSV export; CSV / Goodreads / StoryGraph import with "fetch covers" and "to-read → wishlist" options |
| **Sharing** | Create and revoke public read-only wishlist / collection links |
| **Backup & Restore** | Download a database backup (optionally passphrase-encrypted), restore from one |
| **Portable archive** | Export the whole library as a zip including covers; import with a preview step |

### Users

Manage local users and configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) single sign-on. The OIDC
card contains the issuer, client credentials, scopes, group claim, optional
required access group, group-to-role mappings, automatic provisioning, role
synchronisation and **Save & test configuration**. OIDC client secrets are
write-only and encrypted at rest.

Local users can be added, assigned roles and have their passwords reset. OIDC
identities are created or resolved through the provider and do not use Shelf
passwords. See [Users & roles](user-guide/users-and-roles.md) for the complete
OIDC setup, role-mapping and break-glass guidance.

## Account settings

Local users can change their own display name and password from the account
menu. OIDC identities cannot set a Shelf password or override their provider-
managed display name; make those changes in the identity provider instead.

## Where things are *not* configurable

- Metadata source order (DNB for German ISBNs → Open Library → Hardcover →
  Google Books) is fixed; see [Architecture](architecture.md).
- Outbound API pacing per host is fixed to each provider's published limit.
- Media types are a fixed list: book, kids book, audiobook, eBook, DVD /
  Blu-ray, CD, comic / graphic novel, video game. The scan tab's **Auto** is a
  choice about how to scan, not a ninth type — it is never stored on an item;
  see [Scanning → Media types](user-guide/scanning.md#media-types).
