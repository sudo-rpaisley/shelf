# Shelf documentation

Shelf is a self-hosted home library catalog: scan barcodes or photograph whole
shelves, and Shelf fetches metadata and cover art, tracks lending, series and
reading, and works offline in a bookstore. One Docker container and one SQLite
file; no Shelf-hosted account or service is required. Optional metadata, sync
and vision integrations contact the providers you configure.
