"""Tripwire lint: every read of `items` or `item_copies` in app/ must go
through its TEMP view (app/database.py::get_db()), not the physical table.

T1 added `deleted_at` to `items`/`item_copies`; the earlier soft-delete-seam
plan's own T2 made get_db() create a per-connection `CREATE TEMP VIEW IF NOT
EXISTS items_live AS SELECT * FROM items WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` and T4-T6
repointed the ~172 existing direct reads in app/ onto that view, so the
items census is 0 and this script has guarded it there ever since — a new
direct read of `items` in app/ reds it.

This plan's own T1 added the second view, `copies_live` — a copy is live
only if it AND its item are untrashed (see the CREATE in get_db()). Its T2
taught the same script the second relation, item_copies -> copies_live, as a
parallel set of functions (`find_copy_violations`, `copy_allowlist_mismatches`)
that share the items functions' normaliser and span-matcher rather than
duplicating them. T3-T5 repointed every non-exempt read, driving the copies
census to 0, and this task (T6) is what makes main() fail on it — a new
direct read of item_copies in app/ now reds the build exactly as a new direct
read of items already does.

Only app/**/*.py is scanned. Tests legitimately read the physical tables (a
later plan needs them to) and are out of scope.

G53: prose in app/ that needs to talk about this should say "the items
table"/"items_live" or "the item_copies table"/"copies_live", never write
the literal `FROM items` / `JOIN items` / `FROM item_copies` / `JOIN
item_copies` construct in a comment or docstring — this guard strips
`#`-comment *lines* but not inline prose inside a docstring, and a comment
quoting either construct must not trip it.

Run directly (exit 1 on items violations, items mismatches, copies
violations, or copies allowlist mismatches) or via
tests/test_items_live_lint.py.

    test. An earlier revision checked whether an allowlisted substring
    appeared anywhere in a ±200/300-character window around the match, which

    statement — two reads in the same short function, or a literal a few
    lines from the view's own CREATE, went unreported. Requiring the entry
    to span the match ties each exemption to the one statement it names.
