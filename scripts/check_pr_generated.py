"""Refuse a pull request whose diff carries generated build output.

Three artefacts in this repo are generated, never hand-written: the Tailwind
build `static/css/app.css`, the `SW_VERSION` value in `static/sw.js` (a digest
over the precache set), and the two test-count badges in `README.md`. They are
regenerated on `main` by CI — the `restamp` job in
`.github/workflows/test.yml`, on the push that merges a pull request — and
must not travel in a pull request.

The reason is collision, not tidiness. `app.css` is one minified line and
`SW_VERSION` is one token, so any two PRs that touch a template regenerate the
same line from the same base and conflict with each other — under every merge
method, and through no fault of either author. Measured 2026-09-19: of six PRs
opened that day, four carried both files, and squash-merging the first put the
second into conflict on exactly those two files and nothing else.

    python scripts/check_pr_generated.py                  # HEAD^1 vs HEAD
    python scripts/check_pr_generated.py --base X --head Y

Exit 0 if the three artefacts are identical between the two revisions, 1 if any
differ (naming each one and how to back it out) or if a file can no longer be
parsed.

**The default revisions are written for a GitHub `pull_request` build**, where
the checkout is the merge ref: `HEAD` is the merge result and `HEAD^1` is the
base branch it was merged into. That comparison is the one that answers the
question we actually care about — *does merging this PR change a generated
file?* — and it is deliberately not "the base the PR was opened from": a PR
that is simply behind `main` must not be blamed for a restamp `main` made
since, while a merge commit that resolved a generated value to the branch's
stale side must still be caught.

Not a `make` target, and deliberately not in `checks-fast`. It compares a
commit with its first parent, and in the monorepo every task commit that runs
`make css` would be "refused" — GOTCHAS G80 *requires* a task to commit the
badge restamp. The rule binds GitHub pull requests, which is where the
collision happens; the CI job calls this script directly and nothing local
runs it.
