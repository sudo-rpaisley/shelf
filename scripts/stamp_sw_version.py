"""Derive static/sw.js's SW_VERSION from the contents of its PRECACHE list.

The service worker is cache-first over PRECACHE, keyed by a cache name built
from SW_VERSION. If a precached file's bytes change and SW_VERSION does not,
browsers that already installed the old worker keep serving the stale copy —
neither Cache-Control nor a hard refresh dislodges it. `static/css/app.css` is
precached and is rebuilt by `make css`, so this happened on most releases.

The fix is to stop asking a human to notice. SW_VERSION is now a function of
the precached bytes: `v` + the first 8 hex chars of a sha256 over each sorted
PRECACHE url path and the file's contents. `make css` stamps it; `make
checks-fast` and tests/test_store.py verify it. Any change to a precached file
therefore changes the cache name automatically, and a hand-edit of SW_VERSION
fails the gate.

    python scripts/stamp_sw_version.py            # rewrite sw.js if stale
    python scripts/stamp_sw_version.py --check    # exit 1 if stale, write nothing

Note sw.js itself is deliberately not in PRECACHE — if it were, stamping the
version would change the bytes the version is derived from and never converge.

**The staleness check (`--check`) is advisory on a pull-request CI build, and
only there.** It is unsatisfiable in that context, which is different from
being inconvenient: a PR that touches any of the eight precached files (the
stylesheet, store.js, scanner-engine.js, the two vendored scanners, the
manifest, the two icons) moves the digest, and a PR that restamps SW_VERSION
to get green collides with every other PR touching the same line. So on
`pull_request` the check reports and returns 0; on push to main, and
everywhere local, it still fails. Main is where the person who can run
`make css` actually is. A parse failure (`SwParseError`) is a different
question — the tripwire itself being disarmed — and is never downgraded.
